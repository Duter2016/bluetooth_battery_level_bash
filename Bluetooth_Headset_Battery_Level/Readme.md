# üîãüéß Bluetooth Headset Battery Level

This is a python script to fetch the battery charge level of some Bluetooth headsets.

You need python 3.6 or newer to run the script.

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run

### There are three options:

### Option 1: Install from PyPI
Please ensure you have the BlueZ and python libraries and header files if you are using Ubuntu/Debian based distros:
```bash
sudo apt install libbluetooth-dev python3-dev
```

If you are using *OpenSUSE*, you will need to install `bluez`, `bluez-devel`, `python3-devel`, `python3-pybluez`

Then, install with pip:
```bash
pip3 install bluetooth_battery

bluetooth_battery BT_MAC_ADDRESS_1 ...
```

**You can input addresses for as many devices as you want separated by space.**

_the dependency `pybluez` should be installed automatically, but if not, you may need to install it manually_

--------

### Option 2: Download this repository

```bash
cd Bluetooth_Headset_Battery_Level
chmod +x bluetooth_battery.py

./bluetooth_battery.py BT_MAC_ADDRESS_1 ...
```

_make sure you have `python-pybluez` or `python3-pybluez` or `python3-bluez` installed on your system._

--------

### Option 3: Docker

You must have docker installed on your system.
Clone the repository using `git clone` command. Then run:

```bash
cd Bluetooth_Headset_Battery_Level
docker build -t bluetooth_battery_level .
```

Once the build is complete you can use the below command to run the program:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti --privileged --net=host bluetooth_battery_level "BT_MAC_ADDRESS"
```

--------

### GNOME Extension

There is also a GNOME extension for integrating this program with GNOME desktop environment:
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3991/bluetooth-battery/

### Finding MAC address

There are a variety of utilities that can find the MAC address of your bluetooth device.  Here is one, this command is in the `bluez` package, and the given argument gets a list of all devices it knows about, even if not currently available.
```
$ bluetoothctl devices
Device E8:AB:FA:XX:XX:XX iTeknic IK-BH002
Device D0:77:14:XX:XX:XX Barak's Moto X4
Device E8:AB:FA:XX:XX:XX iTeknic IK-BH002
```
The 1st and 3rd would be relevant here, as those are headsets.

This shows devices that are actually connected.
```
$ bluetoothctl info
Device E8:AB:FA:XX:XX:XX (public)
	Name: iTeknic IK-BH002
	...
```
So you can use
```
bluetooth_battery.py $(bluetoothctl info | awk '/^Device/ {print $2}')
```
to query the battery of all connected devices.

### It didn't work?

You can set the port number manually by adding a dot at the end of mac address, like this: `00:00:00:00:00:00.3`

Try port numbers `1 to 30` to find the one that works for your device. (wait a few seconds between each try)

If that didn't work, **disconnect your device first**, and then try again.

### Still doesn't work?

Please consider that this script doesn't guarantee to support every bluetooth device.

You can open a new issue for discussion or check the existing ones for more information.

## Tested on

- [x] ArchLinux (5.6.14)
- [x] NixOS 20.09 (20.09.2386.ae1b121d9a6)
- [x] Debian GNU/Linux (bullseye 5.9)
